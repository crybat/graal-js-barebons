# GraalJS on JVM

Barebones example on how to use GraalJS on an ordinary JVM\
instead of the GraalVM.

As the project states, the performance will not match the one\
in the GraalVM, much less when compiled to native code.

However, our (simples) benchmarks show that it's fast enough\
to do mapping operations.

The main class contains examples and comparisons on various\
methods one can use to map objects, an example on how to use\
ES6 modules, and a multi-threading example.

Additionally, there's also an example on how to hook basic\
NodeJS scripts with MVN, like installing dependencies and\
linting.
